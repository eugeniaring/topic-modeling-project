# Topic Modeling project

![](images/topicprocess.png)

In this project, we are going to train the BERTopic model to identify topics from e-commerce clothing reviews. We are going to use the E-commerce Clothing Reviews dataset, available on Kaggle. It provides real commercial data of an e-commerce website with reviews provided by customers. There are fields, like clothing id, age of the client, title, review text, and so on.

## Detailed description of the project

The article with the explanations is [Topic Modeling for E-commerce Reviews usingÂ BERTopic]().
